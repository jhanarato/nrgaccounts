## An energy accounting system.
Keep track of solar generation and grid usage based on readings from your meter and
inverter. With three numbers - solar generation, grid export and grid import - you 
can figure out how much you're saving and how much of what you generate you use. At
this point I'm only planning to get it to work for a flat tariff. If you have
time of use rates things get more complicated.
